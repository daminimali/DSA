Example 1:
Input:153 
Output: Yes, it is an Armstrong Number
Explanation: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153

Input:170 
Output: No, it is not an Armstrong Number
Explanation: 1^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 != 170

What are Armstrong Numbers?
Armstrong Numbers are the numbers having the sum of digits raised to power no. of digits is equal to a given number. Examples- 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407, and 1634 are some of the Armstrong Numbers.

Approach:
Let us check one 3-digit Armstrong Number
n=153
sum=0
No. of digits = 3 so we need to cube every digit.
In the First iteration, extract digit 3 from 153 and cube it which becomes 27, add it to sum= 0+27=27 which becomes 27 now
In Second iteration , extract digit 5 from 15 and cube it which becomes 125 , add it to sum = 27 +125 = 152 which becomes 152 now
In Third iteration , extract digit 1 from 1 and cube it which becomes 1 , add it to sum = 152 + 1 = 153 which becomes 153 now.
The original Number was 153 and the sum of cubes = 153.
This means it is an Armstrong Number.

import java.util.*;
class TUF{
static boolean ArmstrongNumber(int n)

    int originalno = n;
    int count = 0;
    int temp = n;
    while (temp != 0)
    {
        count++;
        temp = temp / 10;
    }
    int sumofpower = 0;
    while (n != 0)
    {
        int digit = n % 10;
        sumofpower += Math.pow(digit,count);
        n /= 10;
    }
    return (sumofpower == originalno);
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
    int n1 = 153;
    if (ArmstrongNumber(n1))
    {
        System.out.println("Yes, it is an Armstrong Number\n");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("No, it is not an Armstrong Number\n");
    }
    
}
}
Yes, it is an Armstrong Number

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of digits since we need to traverse every digit and add digits raised to power no. of digits to sum.
Space Complexity: O(1) since no extra space is required
